Also, for beginners, it would help them to have a quick and better understanding of trading markets.<br><br> The data science project would extract key insights from the community by exploratory data analysis, NLP, and machine learning methods. Considering the data is tremendous and changing, big data tools like spark, s3, and hive would be applied. Specifically, valuable tips of stock trading including top 10 positive stocks and negative stocks talked will be demonstrated. Also, hot companies and industries investors care would be shown. In addition, factors that affect or predict votes and comments of a post would be analyzed.

Business Goal: Identification of bear or bull market in different periods based on sentiment analysis <br>Technical proposal: Conduct sentiment analysis for all comments in different period, and assignment positive and negative values to that period. If a period with significant high/low values, it would be determined to be bull/bear market. Also, number of votes and the follow of comments would be considered in analysis.

Possible predictors includes whether the comment is post by the submitter, whether the comment is positive, and when the comment post, etc. Specifically, different machine learning models like linear regression, decision tree regression, and gradient-boosted tress would be applied to train the model, and the best one would be selected based on fitting result. Present findings for top factors with important influence, and the prediction results of different models.
</p>
<br> <br>
<p>
